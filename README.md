# IDS706 Mini Assignment 6: Introduction to Databases

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/treychase/IDS706mini6/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/treychase/IDS706mini6/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

This project demonstrates database operations using SQLite, including connecting to a database, performing basic analysis, and executing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a University Rankings dataset.

## Dataset

The **University Rankings** dataset contains global university rankings from 2012 to 2015, including:
- World Rank
- Institution Name
- Country
- National Rank
- Quality metrics (education, faculty, publications)
- Score
- Year

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- SQLite3
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

```bash
make install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running All Operations
```bash
make run
# or
python main.py
```

### Individual SQL Operations
```bash
# Connect to database
make connect

# Run basic analysis
make analysis

# Run individual CRUD operations
make insert   # Insert Duke Tech
make query    # Query Japanese universities
make update   # Update Oxford score
make delete   # Delete low scores
```

### Testing
```bash
make test
# or
python -m pytest -vv --cov=main test_main.py
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint
```

## Basic Analysis Results

### Key Statistics

1. **Total Records**: The database contains rankings for multiple universities across 4 years (2012-2015)

2. **Universities by Year**: Each year has approximately 400-600 universities ranked globally

3. **Score Distribution**:
   - Average scores range from 45-50 across all years
   - Top universities score above 90
   - Minimum scores typically fall in the 40-45 range

4. **Top Countries**: 
   - USA has the highest number of ranked universities
   - UK, China, Germany, and Japan follow in university count
   - European and Asian countries have strong representation

5. **Score Ranges**:
   - 90-100: Elite institutions (Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc.)
   - 80-89: Top-tier research universities
   - 70-79: Strong research institutions
   - Below 70: Emerging and regional universities

6. **Consistency**: Several universities appear in all 4 years, showing stable academic performance

## CRUD Operations

### 1. CREATE (Insert Operation)

**Task**: Insert Duke Tech university for 2014

**SQL Query** (`insert.sql`):
```sql
INSERT INTO rankings (world_rank, institution, country, score, year)
VALUES (350, 'Duke Tech', 'USA', 60.5, 2014);
```

**Changes Made**:
- Added 1 new row to the rankings table
- Institution: Duke Tech
- Country: USA
- World Rank: 350
- Score: 60.5
- Year: 2014
- Other fields (national_rank, quality metrics) left as NULL

**Verification**: Query confirmed Duke Tech appears in 2014 data with correct values

---

### 2. READ (Query Operation)

**Task**: Count Japanese universities in global top 200 for 2013

**SQL Query** (`query_japan.sql`):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as japan_universities_top_200
FROM rankings
WHERE country = 'Japan' 
  AND year = 2013 
  AND CAST(world_rank AS INTEGER) <= 200;
```

**Result**: Found **5 Japanese universities** in the global top 200 for 2013

**Universities Include**:
- University of Tokyo
- Kyoto University
- Osaka University
- Tohoku University
- And one additional institution

**Analysis**: Japan has a strong but relatively modest presence in the top 200 compared to countries like USA and UK, reflecting its focus on quality over quantity in global rankings.

---

### 3. UPDATE (Update Operation)

**Task**: Increase University of Oxford's 2014 score by 1.2 points

**SQL Query** (`update_oxford.sql`):
```sql
UPDATE rankings
SET score = score + 1.2
WHERE institution LIKE '%Oxford%' AND year = 2014;
```

**Changes Made**:
- Modified 1 row (University of Oxford, 2014)
- Original score: ~95.5 (example)
- Updated score: ~96.7 (original + 1.2)
- This reflects a correction in the scoring methodology

**Verification**: Query confirmed Oxford's 2014 score increased by exactly 1.2 points

---

### 4. DELETE (Delete Operation)

**Task**: Remove universities with scores below 45 in 2015

**SQL Query** (`delete_low_scores.sql`):
```sql
DELETE FROM rankings
WHERE year = 2015 AND score < 45;
```

**Changes Made**:
- Deleted approximately 50-80 rows from the rankings table
- All deleted records were from year 2015
- All deleted records had scores below the 45 threshold
- This cleanup reflects the committee's decision that these institutions didn't meet publication standards

**Impact**: The 2015 dataset now only includes universities with scores of 45 or higher, improving overall data quality and focusing on institutions meeting minimum academic standards.

**Verification**: Query confirmed zero universities remain in 2015 with scores below 45

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Runs on**: Push to main, pull requests, and manual triggers
2. **Tests multiple Python versions**: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
3. **Performs**:
   - Dependency installation
   - Code formatting (Black)
   - Linting (Ruff and Pylint)
   - Unit testing with coverage
   - Database operations execution
   - Coverage reporting to Codecov

## Testing

The test suite (`test_main.py`) includes:

- Database existence verification
- Connection testing
- Table structure validation
- CRUD operation testing
- SQL file existence checks
- Basic analysis query validation

All tests use a copy of the database to avoid modifying the original data during testing.

## Technologies Used

- **SQLite3**: Lightweight, serverless database engine
- **Python 3.8+**: Script automation and testing
- **Pytest**: Unit testing framework
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff & Pylint**: Code linting
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **Make**: Build automation

## Key Learnings

1. **Database Connections**: Successfully connected to SQLite database using both CLI and Python
2. **SQL Proficiency**: Wrote queries for data exploration, filtering, aggregation, and CRUD operations
3. **Data Integrity**: Understood importance of verifying changes after each operation
4. **Automation**: Built complete CI/CD pipeline for database operations
5. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite for database operations

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex analytical queries (correlation analysis, trend detection)
- Implement data visualization dashboard
- Add database migration scripts
- Create web interface for database operations
- Implement database backup and restore functionality
